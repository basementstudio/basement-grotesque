The objective of this boilerplate is to set up everything the developer will need (in terms of configuration) to start a next + typescript project. Eslint, prettier and husky are configured to work independent of the user's IDE configuration (as long as it's vscode).

## Featured aspects of the stack

- Typescript
- NextJS

## Things to note

- It comes with Inter (it's better to host fonts here rather than getting them from google fonts). Remove it if you are not going to use it.
- Pages, components, etc... are located under `/src`. If you are changing this, be sure to also update `tsconfig.json`'s `baseUrl`.

If you found you needed to make extra config to make this work better, feel free to submit a pr suggesting your changes. Our focus is for you to get up and running with the least steps and burden as possible.
