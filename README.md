# basement grotesque

basement grotesque is the studio‚Äôs first venture into the daunting but exciting world of type design. Of course, we had to start with a heavy weight: striking and unapologetically so; flawed but charming and full of character.

The typeface is a work in progress, open to anyone who shares our visual and graphic sensibilities. You're invited to check our journey as we iterate, change, and add new weights and widths in the future as we learn by doing.

## **Design**

We set out inspired by the expressiveness of early 19th-century grotesque typefaces and the boldness and striking visuals of the contemporary revival of brutalist aesthetics. This is the first step in a very ambitious path we‚Äôve set for ourselves.

- This font has 413 unique glyphs.
- Discretionary and standard ligatures (14 total).
- Language support for Western and Central European languages.
- Stylistic sets and glyph alternates.
- Old style and lining figures.
